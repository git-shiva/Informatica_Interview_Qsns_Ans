While Introducing yourself focus on below points Make sure you add below point in detail:
---------
Explain what flavors of Data Projects you worked on so far (i.e. Data Migration, Data Marts, Building Enterprise warehouse/Enterprise Data Hub/Data Lakes and Data Conversion (i.e. from On-prem to cloud)
Explain Different types of source data you handled so far (i.e. Types of relational DB, File, XML, API/Webservices, Salesforce, Semi structured data)
Explain Different types of Databases you loaded into i.e Oracle/Db2/SQL Server OR Azure/Redshift/GBQ
Any code automation/generic template which you used or worked on your projects (either Python script based or using Informatica/IICS)
Working experience on End to end SDLC (i.e. Requirement Gathering/Analysis à Design à Review à Build/Unit Test à QA Support à Production Handoff à Post production warranty)
Apart from Informatica/IICS what other ETL tools you worked on i.e. BODS/IICS/Datastage/Talend or ANY cloud ETL tools (Metadata manager, Analyst, DVO, Data Quality)
Any Realtime experience connecting/bringing Realtime data (i.e. API/CDC/Webservices) and its challenges
Interaction/coordination with Business/Product Owners à Architect Team à QA/UAT Support à Deployment Team à Support Team
Any ERWIN/Modelling tool experience

Complex integration workflows from heterogeneous data sources:
--------------------------------------------------
When they asked for any situation, always make sure your information should support with practical/live example from your project. E.g. As part of building EDW Project where you need to integrate multiple sources what are the challenges you encountered while integrating different sources
Like. Files, Mainframe, Databases, Salesforce data, Realtime data, semi structured data (JSON,Kafka)

For each and every question follow the strategy of STAR (Situation (Issues/Assignment given to you) à Task (your Responsibility) à Approach (what is your approach/Steps taken) à Results (what is the outcome)
E.g. In any of the project if you have given a task to improve the job which is taking XX days/Hours, what are the steps you have taken to reduce the hours

Elaborate your working experience b/w Informatica PC vs IICS:
-----------------------------------------------
Tool  comparison
Challenges converting the code from Informatica to IICS
IICS PDO (Push down Optimization) and its benefits
E.g. Connecting multiple mapplets wont work in IICS where it will work in PC
https://onlinehelp.informatica.com/iics/prod/cdi/en/index.htm#page/cloud-data-integration-odbc-connector/Pushdown_optimization_functions.html -> refer link where some of the functions won’t work using PDO

Code deployments (especially schedulers)
How Jobs scheduling/dependency has taken i.e. using Informatica tool/Control-M/Uc-4/ or any third party tools
GitHub/SVN or any version controlling tools
_______________________________________________________________

Building Dimensions/Facts:
Always explain logic using Informatica/IICS code along with live examples and efficient way of writing code to handle huge loads as well ( Partitions in On-prem/Informatica vs PDO in IICS/Cloud)
Type1, Type2 and Types of Fact loads
Phases of brining the data from Source to final destination tables (which one are transient and which one are persistent tables)
Examples of Handling huge volumes
